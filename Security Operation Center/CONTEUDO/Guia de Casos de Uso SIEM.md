## :dart: O guia para alavancar a sua carreira

Este guia explora os principais casos de uso de um SIEM (Security Information and Event Management), destacando como essa ferramenta essencial pode ser utilizada para identificar, investigar e mitigar ameaças de segurança dentro de uma organização. Com exemplos práticos e cenários comuns, você entenderá melhor o valor do SIEM na proteção da infraestrutura de TI.

### 1. Detecção de Ameaças Internas

#### Descrição:
O SIEM pode monitorar e correlacionar eventos em tempo real para detectar atividades anômalas vindas de dentro da organização, como acessos não autorizados, uso indevido de dados sensíveis, e comportamentos fora do padrão de usuários internos.

| End User DNS Queries to Unauthorized DNS Servers | Security | Detects a scenario where a host, that is itself not a DNS server, is trying to send DNS requests to unauthorized DNS servers. Authorized DNS servers are represented by the ""DNS Server"" group. In a typical scenario, end hosts always send DNS requests to authorized DNS servers which in turn communicate to other DNS servers - so this behavior may indicate malware running on the end host. | End User DNS Queries to Unauthorized DNS Servers | ipProto = 17 AND destIpPort = 53 AND destIpAddr NOT IN (Group@PH_SYS_APP_DNS_SERVER) AND destIpAddr NOT IN (Group@PH_SYS_NETWORK_PUBLIC_DNS) AND srcIpAddr NOT IN (Group@PH_SYS_APP_DNS_SERVER,Group@PH_SYS_APP_ACCELOPS,Group@PH_SYS_DEVICE_FSM) AND srcIpAddr IN (Group@PH_SYS_NETWORK_ENTERPRISE_INTERNAL_NET) AND eventType IN (Group@PH_SYS_EVENT_PermitNetTraffic, Group@PH_SYS_EVENT_NetflowTraffic, Group@PH_SYS_EVENT_BiNetflowTraffic, Group@PH_SYS_EVENT_DenyNetTraffic) |

| Excessive End User DNS Queries | Security | Detects a scenario where a host, that is itself not an DNS server, is sending excessive DNS requests. Authorized DNS servers are represented by the ""DNS Server"" group. In a typical scenario, the frequency of end host DNS requests is not high unless, there is a script running - this might indicate the presence of malware on the end host. | Excessive End User DNS Queries | ipProto = 17 AND destIpPort = 53 AND srcIpAddr NOT IN (Group@PH_SYS_APP_DNS_SERVER) AND reptDevIpAddr IN (Group@PH_SYS_DEVICE_FIREWALL,Group@PH_SYS_DEVICE_ROUTER_SWITCH) AND srcIpAddr NOT IN (Group@PH_SYS_APP_ACCELOPS,Group@PH_SYS_DEVICE_FSM) AND srcIpAddr IN (Group@PH_SYS_NETWORK_ENTERPRISE_INTERNAL_NET) AND eventType IN (Group@PH_SYS_EVENT_PermitNetTraffic, Group@PH_SYS_EVENT_NetflowTraffic, Group@PH_SYS_EVENT_BiNetflowTraffic, Group@PH_SYS_EVENT_DenyNetTraffic) |

| Excessive Repeated DNS Queries To Same Domain | Security | Detects an usually high frequency of DNS name resolution queries from the same host to the same domain name in a short period of time. This is not expected behavior since, in a typical scenario, the domain name resolution is cached at the end point. Repeated queries indicates that a special DNS client is likely running at the end host that is trying to make use of fast flux techniques to get back many infected hosts behind a crafted domain name. | Excessive Repeated DNS Queries To Same Domain | eventType IN (Group@PH_SYS_EVENT_CommonDNSTraffic) |
